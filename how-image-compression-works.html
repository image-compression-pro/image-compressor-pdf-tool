<h1>How Image Compression Works</h1>

<p>
Image compression is a method used to reduce the size of image files so they load faster and use less storage.
It is widely used on websites, apps, and online platforms.
</p>

<h2>Types of Image Compression</h2>
<p>
There are two main types of image compression: lossy and lossless.
Lossy compression reduces file size by removing some image data, while lossless compression keeps all image data intact.
</p>

<h2>Why Image Compression Is Important</h2>
<p>
Compressed images improve website loading speed, reduce bandwidth usage, and enhance user experience.
Search engines prefer fast-loading websites, which helps improve SEO.
</p>

<h2>Best Image Formats for Compression</h2>
<ul>
  <li>JPG – ideal for photographs</li>
  <li>PNG – best for images with transparency</li>
  <li>WebP – modern format with high compression efficiency</li>
</ul>
